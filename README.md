# Webviewerdebug

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Currently the viewer will load in Safari and Firefox an the heading color will be changed to blue. It will sometimes load in Chrome, but most times the native client crashes.

To run a version with correct content encoding headings set use 'npm run build' followed by 'npm run start:aot'
